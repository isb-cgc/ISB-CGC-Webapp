Developer Specific Notes 
------------------------

Health checks and HTTPS
    - Health checks can fail if they are not sent over HTTPS; if this is happening they should be disabled until they
      can be reliably run over HTTPS, because otherwise the VM will constantly reboot in an attempt to 'fix' the app


Gulp+Windows
------------
1. Install Windows NodeJS
2. Open the NodeJS command prompt as the current user (do not Run As Administrator)
3. Install Gulp globally with `npm install gulp -g`
4. Change directories to the project directory
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `gulp`
7. If you are still having dependency problems, install each package by hand *while in the project directory* with `npm install <package name>`
