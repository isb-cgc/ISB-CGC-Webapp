This set of scripts allows you to set up a personal Juypter Notebook server running on a Google Cloud VM. While
similar in function to Google Cloud Datalab, this approach does not require you to run a gcloud command on your
desktop. Once it is up and running, there is no more desktop code component. The notebook server requires a password you
provide as part of the setup, and also installs a GCP firewall rule to only accept traffic from the IP range you
specify in the setEnvVars.sh file.

1) Edit the `setEnvVars.sh` file to personalize your installation
2) Run `./startAndLaunch.sh`
3) Browser will (eventually) open to the new VM. Since the certificate is self-signed, you will be required to
   accept the certificate you just created when you first hit the VM.
4) Start a notebook. Note that the system creates five distinct virtualenvs you can choose from to customize your
   environment for each notebook.
5) Alternately, upload a notebook. If you upload an existing notebook, it will select the virtualenv it was
   created with if a matching name exists.
6) The notebook server will start automatically when the VM is started up. CURRENTLY *YOU* must shut the
   VM down when you are done! This can be done using the script `stopVM.sh`.
7) With the VM shut down, you can run the script `restartVM.sh` to bring it back up again.
8) *YOU* are also responsible for deleting the VM, releasing the static IP address, and deleting the firewall rule when you
   retire the VM. For deleting the VM, use the script `deleteVM.sh`. To remove the firewall rule and release the static
   IP address, run `tearDownNetwork.sh`.
9) You can launch your browser to the server anytime using the `run_browser.sh` command (assuming the VM has been started
   using `restartVM.sh`). It pulls the static IP and port you specified from the `setEnvVars.sh` file.
   Be sure to remember your password!
10) The `get_pass.py` script this directory supports the `startAndLaunch.sh` script. It is basically the snippet of code in the
    Jupyter server code base that generates password hashes. The `install_script.sh` is what is uploaded to the VM to
    get the server installed and running.
