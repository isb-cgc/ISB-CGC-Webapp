Call this from a daemon process that run this every X minutes. Decides whether or not to
shutdown an inactive VM running a Jupyter Notebook Server on a Google VM. Steps:

1) Check the last X hours of activity logs to see if the machine has been active. Have
accumlated empirical stats on what consistitutes an idle VM, where there is e.g. basal
network activity no matter what. Note those thresholds will be exceeded at least once a
day by Google VM maintenance logging, etc. That is not accounted for.

2) Previous logs might be ~10 minutes old. If we pass the first test, do a final check
of new Stackdriver metrics to see if there is recent activity.

3) User might still be starting to use the machine again in the last minute or two. If we
pass the first two checks, run two processes for X seconds in parallel to check TCP traffic
off the server port, and to check CPU usage of all (first generation only!) child processes
of the Notebook server.

4) If all previous checks indicate a shutdown is warranted, return True, else return False.
