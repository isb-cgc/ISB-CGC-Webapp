# Uses netstat and top to determine if child processes of the Jupyter Notebook server have any
# CPU activity. Note that tiny amounts of activity could still present as 0.0 CPU, so it is
# useful to recall this for  e.g. 60 seconds.
# Requires the configuration script to be in the /home/${USER_NAME}/.jupyter/bin directory
