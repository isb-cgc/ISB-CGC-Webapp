                        <p>
                            NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based repository of publicly available cancer
                            imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node
                            within the broader NCI <a href="https://datacommons.cancer.gov/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)</a> infrastructure that provides
                            secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.
                            All data hosted by IDC will be available publicly. The current content of IDC is populated
                            using the radiology collections from <a href="https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)</a>, as well as data
                            collected by other major NCI initiatives, such as TCGA, CPTAC, NLST, and HTAN. IDC does not
                            perform de-identification of images but will accept data de-identified by TCIA or other Data
                            Coordinating Centers that are approved by NCI Security.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IDC provides access to the data standardized using the <a href="https://www.dicomstandard.org/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM)</a>
                            standard. IDC collaborates with the projects generating the data to
                            harmonize alternative formats into DICOM representation. Its content includes not only
                            images, but also image annotations and analysis results, and is linked using common
                            identifiers to the other types of cancer data, such as proteomics and genomics datasets in
                            the <a href="https://datacommons.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
                            Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)</a>. Access to the data is supported using standard
                            interfaces. Given the IDC's role as an imaging data science platform, a major focus is on
                            establishing best practices for imaging research. In this regard, a key role of IDC is in
                            preparing and adapting commonly used tools for image analysis to be run on cloud
                            environments with IDC-hosted datasets. Summarized derived data from analyses previously
                            run will be associated with imaging data on IDC for ease of use by the research community.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Data Types</h5>
                        <p>
                            IDC contains various types of images and image-derived data harmonized using the DICOM standard.
                            As of October 2022, IDC contains the following types of images:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clinical and preclinical imaging</li>
                                <li>Radiological images (e.g., CT, MRI, PET)</li>
                                <li>Digital pathology images</li>
                                <li>Multispectral microscopy images</li>
                                <li>Image annotations (e.g., planar and volumetric, regions of interest)</li>
                                <li>Parametric maps derived from images (e.g., perfusion and diffusion maps)</li>
                                <li>Measurements derived from the images (e.g., radiomics features for the annotated regions of interest)</li>
                                <li>Expert assessments of the image findings (e.g., qualitative characterizations of lesion appearance)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Data Submission to IDC</h5>
                        <p>
                            Currently IDC will consider submissions from NCI-funded driving projects and data from special
                            selected projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IDC only hosts public datasets. It does not support access limitations,
                            such as data embargoes or sequestration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Submitters of data to IDC must ensure that the data have been de-identified with respect to
                            protected health information (PHI). Currently, IDC accepts data de-identified by
                            <a href="https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The
                            Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)</a>. Datasets de-identified by other data coordinating centers
                            (DCC) may be considered but in such cases further information will be required (see
                            <a href="{% static 'docs/2023-06-02.IDC.Risk.Mitigation.Form.docx' %}">attached form</a>
                            that will be used to collect information about how de-identification is done).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are interested in making your data available within IDC, please contact us by sending
